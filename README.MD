	*[CSS Lightbox Reference](https://tympanus.net/codrops/2011/12/26/css3-lightbox/)


##Future Implementations

* I would like to implement [Paperclip](https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip) for users to upload their photos

* Social sharing: would like to implement so that users can become 'friends' with other users and share photos

* Comments and 'likes' to be added to my photo schemas.
